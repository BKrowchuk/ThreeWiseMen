- **Better Visual Organization:** Logical grouping with clear visual hierarchy
- **Improved Responsiveness:** Optimized layouts for all device sizes
- **Professional Appearance:** Modern, polished interface design
- **Better User Experience:** Easier navigation and form completion

### Calculator Card Width Optimization

**Latest Enhancement:** Calculator cards now take up most of the available screen width for maximum space utilization.

**Technical Changes:**

- **Container Layout:** Changed `calculator-container` from CSS Grid (`1fr 1fr`) to Flexbox (`flex-direction: column`)
- **Card Expansion:** Added `width: 100%` and `min-width: 0` to `form-section` and `results-section`
- **Full-Width Cards:** Calculator cards expand to fill available horizontal space instead of being constrained by grid columns
- **Responsive Behavior:** Maintained responsive stacking while maximizing horizontal space usage on larger screens

**Benefits:**

- **Maximum Screen Usage:** Calculator cards now utilize the full width of the screen
- **Better Form Layout:** More space for input fields and form organization
- **Improved Readability:** Results and calculations have more room to display
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Less wasted space and better visual balance

These improvements ensure that users can efficiently use the full width of their screens while maintaining excellent usability across all device types, creating a more professional and user-friendly financial planning experience.

### Bug Fix: TypeError in parseCurrency Method

**Issue Resolved:** Fixed `TypeError: value.replace is not a function` error that occurred when non-string values were passed to the `parseCurrency` method.

**Root Cause:** The `parseCurrency` method was calling `.replace()` on values that might not be strings (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or other data types), causing runtime errors.

**Technical Fixes Applied:**

- **Enhanced parseCurrency Method:** Added type checking to ensure values are strings before calling `.replace()`
- **Safety Checks in Computed Properties:** Added null/undefined checks in reduce operations for `totalAssets`, `totalLiabilities`, `totalIncome`, `totalFixedExpenses`, `totalVariableExpenses`, and `totalSavings`
- **Cross-Calculator Consistency:** Applied the same safety improvements to all calculator components

**Files Modified:**

- `src/views/CashFlowCalculator.vue` - Enhanced parseCurrency and computed properties
- `src/views/NetWorthCalculator.vue` - Enhanced parseCurrency and computed properties
- `src/views/DownPaymentCalculator.vue` - Enhanced parseCurrency method
- `src/views/SavingsCalculator.vue` - Enhanced parseCurrency method

**Benefits:**

- **Error Prevention:** Eliminates runtime errors from invalid data types
- **Improved Stability:** More robust handling of edge cases and data corruption
- **Better User Experience:** Prevents application crashes during calculations
- **Data Integrity:** Safer processing of form inputs and stored data

## Save to Profile Functionality

### Overview

A comprehensive "Save to Profile" system has been implemented that allows users to selectively save calculator results to their persistent financial profile. This creates a clear distinction between calculator tools (exploratory) and planning/tracking features (persistent).

### New Components

#### 1. Profile Store (`src/store/profile.js`)

**Purpose:** Centralized management of persistent user financial data separate from calculator results.

**Store Structure:**

```javascript

    rrspFhsa: 0,
    assets: { /* individual asset values */ },
    liabilities: { /* individual liability amounts */ },
    budget: { /* expense and savings categories */ },
    goals: { /* financial targets and timelines */ }
  },
  netWorthHistory: [], // Historical snapshots
  cashFlowHistory: [], // Historical snapshots
  lastUpdated: { /* timestamps for different sections */ }
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Separate storage from calculator results
- Historical data tracking (last 12 snapshots)
- Timestamp tracking for all updates
- Selective field updating capabilities
